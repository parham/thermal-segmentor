Evaluation metrics
* IoU
** mIoU
* Recall-Precision
* F-measure
* SSIM
* ODS
* OIS


*** The IoU is a value between zero and 100, where a larger value indicates a more accurate segmentation. 
    The mIoU is then the mean value across all the classes in the dataset.

*** For evaluation, I think we can start checking the intersection of segmented regions. 
    Then we will use IoU for the regions with highest intersection.
